# Modeling project and grants on Wikidata and Schema.org .

## Introducton


## Goals

1. Funding-agencies/funder perspective
    1. Promote opening up of funding data
    1. Ability to answer questions on the impact and effectiveness of funding fo research, knowledge increase and welfare


1. Interoperability goals:
    1. alignment between schema.org and wikidata
    1. query federation  
    
1: Use cases 
1: Requirements and queries supported

## Methodology

1. Semantic model  
1. Data-driven (starting from datasets. in particular see list almugabo)
 
## Issues

1. Difficulty in creating new properties in both communities.
1. Multiplicity of actors
1. Nonexisting standards/consensus about the terminology 

## State of the art and resources

1. Cerif EUROCRIS data model (ER)
1. Non-systematic solutions in specific cases (example Scholia) and based on specific dataset features (for the above example CORDIS data)


## Modeling

1. Description of the model

    1. Essential types (grant. project. funding scheme. funding agency. particpant [person. organisation])
    1. Specific relevant design decisions: 
    
        1. modeling the funder space with types "funding scheme", "funding agency", and "grant" (distinguishing the organisational. policy and economical features of a funding process)
        1. separation between grant and project
        
    1. Data validation issues: Shape expression. presence or absence of certain fields of the model
